   <h2>Balance Your Budget - With Lunch</h2>
  
   <p>Setting and sticking to a budget is a good way to see where your money goes, but tracking every little thing can be daunting.</p>
 
   <p>That is one reason many people give up on their budgets. It is easier to stick to a plan if you start small, say, with lunch. You might be surprised at just how much people spend on this mid-day meal.</p>
  
   <p>Making a few key changes can save you big money and you would not go hungry, either.</p>

   <section>
		
    <p>Take a moment to remember an event that you experienced as a child. Pick something that’s important to you – an event that really shaped for the better the person you are today. Now ask yourself: are you sure this event truly happened?</p>
        
    <p>Suppose, for example, that some well-intentioned person could have deliberately planted a vivid false memory of this fictional event in your consciousness, believing that the memory would change you in ways that would benefit your life. How would you feel to discover that this was the case? Perhaps you’d be touched that someone cared so much about your wellbeing that they would give you such a personal and life-changing ‘gift’? Or maybe outraged, that this person had brainwashed you without your consent?</p>

   <p>Pepe the Frog is a popular meme on 4chan despite being branded a "hate symbol" by the Anti-Defamation League
   The site provides a place to anonymously post text and images about a range of interests, including Japanese anime, video games, cooking, science and cars.</p>

   <p>These include the "politically incorrect" board, in which racist and homophobic comments run rampant.
   It has been linked to the rise of the so-called alt-right movement, whose followers are outspoken in their attacks on  multiculturalism, globalisation and immigration even if they differ on much else.</p>

<h2>How The Street Light has Given a Hi-Tech Makeover?</h2>
<article>
  <heeder>
 <section>

  <p>Not only are light bulbs getting sharper and more energy efficient as they are upgraded to LEDs, but they increasingly help fight crime, promote safe cycling and even protect turtles.</p>

  <p>That's because street lights are also becoming the eyes and ears of "smart" cities.</p>

  <p>Lamp posts double as data collectors, communicating with a central control system that makes automated decisions about when they are on, for how long, and the brightness.
  Their supporters say the benefits include safer streets, calmer roads and considerable cost savings.</p>

<h2>The Mystery of Why You Cannot Remember Being a Baby</h2>

   <section>

   <p>You’re out to lunch with someone you’ve known for a few years. Together you’ve held parties, celebrated birthdays, visited parks and bonded over your mutual love of ice cream. You’ve even been on holiday together. In all, they’ve spent quite a lot of money on you – roughly £63,224. The thing is: you can’t remember any of it.</p>

   <p>From the most dramatic moment in life – the day of your birth – to first steps, first words, first food, right up to nursery school, most of us can’t remember anything of our first few years. Even after our precious first memory, the recollections tend to be few and far between until well into our childhood. How come?</p>

   <p>This gaping hole in the record of our lives has been frustrating parents and baffling psychologists, neuroscientists and linguists for decades. It was a minor obsession of the father of psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud, who coined the phrase ‘infant amnesia’ over 100 years ago.</p>
